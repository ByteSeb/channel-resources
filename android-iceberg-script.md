# The Android Iceberg Explained

Status: Uploaded

- **Intro**
    
    Android is not only the most used mobile operating system, but also the most used OS in the entire history. According to StatCounter, it represents the 44% out of all OSes in the world. But do you think that you really know all about it?

    *(Intro)*
    
    Hello, world. ByteSeb here. If you’re new to the channel, I make videos about tech, software and everything in between. 
    
    The Tech Icebergs series that I made is the most popular one in my channel, and I think that’s fair, because these videos tend to have some really interesting stuff. The last iceberg was about Linux, you can check it out in the card that you’re seeing right now, or in the description below. 
    
    It took me a while to make this iceberg because even if you don’t believe me, it was a little bit hard to find some weird and interesting stuff aside from the technical parts of Android. This is where I took inspiration from an iceberg that a viewer sent me by email and modified it to fit the most interesting parts into a long video, that will probably have to be separated intro parts. The main user that made it is just called “Android”, but it looks like a lot of other people contributed too. The original one is huge, with over 400 entries, that’s why this video is so long, and I think that even after watching it, you should visit the original one to know some other little details and thank the creators. 
    
    Also, if I get any information or pronunciation wrong, please, correct me in the comments. English is not my first language. I might also have to censor some things because I probably wouldn’t be able to monetize the video if I didn’t, and I have to eat.
    
    This video only has educational and entertainment purposes.
    
    If you want the script to make a translated version of this video, you’ll have it in the description below, along with all the sources I used. Just give me credits, and also include these sources.
    
    In this iceberg, we’re gonna see entries like consoles and weird objects running Android, creepy apps, cancelled phones and projects and special edition phones like the Pepsi Phone.
    
    Now, let’s begin.

        Android is an open source operating system written in Java, focused primarily on touchscreen devices, like phones, tablets, smartwatches, etcetera. Its first release was back on September 23rd of 2008, made by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears and Chris White. In 2005, Google acquired the company and has been working on the project ever since, with the latest version being Android 13.
        
        It was called this way due to its creator, Andy Rubin, whose nickname was “Android”.

        As I previously mentioned, Android is open source, but it has some really important proprietary or closed source components, called: The Google Play Services or GMS. Most Android phones have them by default, and some apps even need them to work properly. As examples, you have the Google Play Store, Google apps, including Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Drive, Google Photos and Chrome and some other ones that you don’t notice at first glance, like the Firebase API, which handles connections to databases, telemetry and notifications for apps hosted on Google servers. These services also take care of handling payments, giving exposure notifications, showing ads and providing the AR libraries for some apps with ARCore.
        
        Even though practically all phones have Google Play Services, if you were a new phone company, you would have to comply with Google’s conditions for implementing them.

        There are and there have been multiple Android phone companies. It is truly a very complicated market.
        
        I’m just going to quickly mention the most popular ones, and their main lineups.
        
        Samsung, is one of the top, if not the top phone manufacturer in the world. Mainly known for its Galaxy lineup.
        
        Next, we have Xiaomi, known for its good value phones, with sub brands like Redmi and Poco. 
        
        Then, we have Huawei, a brand that has lost a lot of popularity due to its US ban, but we’ll talk about it later. Its main lineups are Mate and P.
        
        Moving on, we have Oppo, with its Reno series.
        
        Also, Xiaomi’s competition: Realme, with the self titled and GT series.
        
        We can’t forget about the favorite one of a lot of you, and that’s OnePlus, with the self titled and Nord series.
        
        Google itself, that makes some very modder friendly and “stock” phones. Only having their Pixel lineup, previously called Nexus.
        
        Another brand is Motorola, having its G and Edge series.
        
        HTC was a giant some years ago, but they have slowly faded out. Still, I think they deserve a mention.
        
        LG recently moved away from the phone market, but I think we all can agree that they had some pretty interesting phones, with the LG G series.
        
        And the new brand that everyone’s talking about: Nothing, that just released the Nothing Phone 1, with a pretty unique design, and some close to stock software.
        
        ## Android skins

            - [x]  MIUI
            - [x]  EMUI
            - [x]  FunTouchOS
            - [x]  ColorOS
            - [x]  OxygenOS
            - [x]  RealmeUI
            - [x]  PixelUI
            - [x]  MyUX
            - [x]  NothingOS
            
        
        Android is open source, which means that everyone can make their modifications to the code and create their own versions. This is what most big brands have done, creating what is called an “Android skin”, as it mostly only changes some visual aspects, but some of them include cool features not available in the so called “stock” version of Android. An example of this is the ability to turn apps into floating windows, a desktop mode and replacing some of the default apps.
        
        Some of the “heaviest” skins, meaning, the ones with the most amount of changes, to the point where some could be considered as “bloatware” are Samsung’s OneUI, that makes its own design, using blur, moving popups to the bottom of the screen for better reachability, but also adding a good amount of customization, features and compatibility with their ecosystem.
        
        We have Xiaomi’s MIUI, that actually started as a Custom ROM, and now is heavily inspired by iOS, with modifications like the separated quick settings and notifications panel, Super wallpapers and a gaming mode.
        
        Next. we have EMUI, Huawei’s Android skin, that even if they are stopping to use it in certain devices, it does change quite some stuff. It is also inspired by iOS, with similar app icons, including the shape, and as far as I know, they don’t even have an app drawer.
        
        A very unknown one for some people is FunTouchOS, Vivo’s skin. That has its own design and again, adds little changes like improvements to the Always On Display, a custom Game mode and floating apps.
        
        Then, we have Oppo’s ColorOS, that tries to not add too many features, but still modifying stuff to make it more useful and customizable, as you can change your accent color, font and even icon pack.
        
        Then, let’s mention OxygenOS, that was one of the most loved android skins ever. It featured a close to stock Android base, with a couple of subtle customizations and added features that Android didn’t have back then.
        
        Now, OxygenOS and RealmeUI, are both based on ColorOS, which makes them very similar to the one previously mentioned. In fact, it is very hard to tell them apart sometimes. 
        
        A lot of people got angry and disappointed with this move, as Oppo now owns OnePlus and seems to be losing its identity, but that is another topic.
        
        Reaching the more “stock” Android skins, we have of course, Google’s Pixel UI. This is basically the standard for how a vanilla skin should be. Follows Material Design, has the latest updates and adds a couple of Pixel exclusive features, like free Google Photos storage, Magic eraser and the Now Playing music auto-detection features.
        
        Motorola also has its own mini Android skin, which a lot of people don’t really know that has a name, that is “MyUX”. It adds mainly only exclusive Motorola gestures like doing a chopping motion twice to toggle the flashlight or flipping your phone over to enable Do Not Disturb.
        
        NothingOS has also few changes, being the main ones to customize the Glyph lights on the back of your Nothing Phone, a custom font, and a big circle in the quick settings that groups your network tiles.
        
        I would like to know which Android skin is your favorite one and why. I personally love stock Android, but I don’t mind a few customizations here and there, like what ColorOS or MyUX do.

            [https://mashable.com/article/actual-android-oreos](https://mashable.com/article/actual-android-oreos)
            
        
        If you’ve used Android, you have definitely seen it. It is the green and white Android’s mascot.
        
        Now, the Bugdroid name is actually an unofficial one, but it is the name some Android devs used to refer to this character, so it’s the closest thing that we have to an actual name.
        
        But did you know that Bugdroid was not the first option for a logo? Meet the Dandroids, the first sketch for an Android mascot. These look very different and even a little unsettling, but that’s just my opinion.
        
        Irina Blok, the creator of Bugdroid, said that she looked at the universal signs for the male and female public restrooms and she imagined a robot version of them. It is said that she also took inspiration from a character also called “Android” from an Atari Lynx title called “Gauntlet: The Third Encounter”. They surely do look a lot similar, but as far as I know, Google hasn’t said anything about it.
        
        The Android’s logo has changed over the years, with mainly subtle modifications to the green tone. However, when Android 10 was introduced, Google opted for a cleaner version, with just the head with a colder tone of green. Personally, I love this new redesign.
        
        The green robot has also appeared as an easter egg in several games. Exclusively for the Android version of Jetpack Joyride, in Crossy Road, as a playable character, in Sonic Dash, also as a limited time playable character, in Terraria, as a pet that can be summoned with an item called the Shiny Black Slab. The game CookieRun also has a reference to Android, with the character Cookiedroid, that as a fun fact, has a Google Play themed pet and dislikes the Apple Cookie.
        
        You probably didn’t know that a real life Android Statue Garden exists in Mountain View, California, where you can see statues of Bugdroid themed according to the version that they represent, like a Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich and Marshmallow statues.
        
        You can find in the internet collectible Bugdroid toys, but there are real Android themed candies too. For example, in 2013, Google partnered with Nestlé to send 500 limited edition Bugdroids made of chocolate to announce their OS update. 
        
        In the Google IO of 2012, Google gave to some of the visitors a Bugdroid Jelly Bean container to match with the update of that year.
        
        Finally, in the Google IO of 2017, people were given actual Bugdroid themed Oreo cookies. I think we all would have liked to eat these.
        
        Weirdly, there are people that have made Bugdroid Halloween costumes, like what you’re seeing right now. Maybe we should try it some time.
        
        ## Android vs iOS
        
        In the desktop world, the rivalry is between Windows, Mac and Linux, but in the mobile space, it is Android vs iOS because they're the two main phone OSes.
        
        People that are in favor of iOS claim that it is a more secure, private and reliable platform. Meanwhile, people that are in favor of Android is usually because they prefer a more open ecosystem, with more choice for devices and programs.
        
        I think that both operating systems have pros and cons, but personally, I prefer Android.

        There are different types of Android releases. We have main releases, for example, from Android 12 to Android 13. Minor releases, like going from Android 3.0 to 3.1, Tablet releases, like Android 12L and security patches, that should be a monthly security and stability update independent from your Android version. 
        
        Let’s list all of them quickly. 
        
        Starting with Android 1.0, that came out in September of 2008 and introduced the Android Market, a predecessor to the Play Store, folders in the home screen and had Google apps like Gmail, Google Contacts, Maps, Talk, Search and YouTube.
        
        Its successor, Android 1.1 Petit Four, released the next year had a few improvements, like details and reviews for businesses in Maps, the ability to save attachments in messages and filters in the Camera and Photos apps.
        
        Android 1.5 Cupcake in late 2009 introduced support for widgets, video recording and playback for MPEG 4 format, stereo support for Bluetooth and the ability to upload videos to YouTube.
        
        Android 1.6 Donut, released only a couple of months after its previous version, allowed users to select multiple photos to delete them, introduced support for WVGA screen resolutions and redesigned the Android Market. It is believed that the beta dessert name for this version could originally be Donut Burger.
        
        The next version, called Android 2.0 Eclair came out again months after the previous release, still, in 2009. It added compatibility with HTML5, auto brightness and live wallpapers.
        
        In 2010, a 2.1 revision came out, with the addition of Pinch to zoom, a full screen app drawer and revamped apps.
        
        Months later, Android 2.2 Froyo, short for Frozen Yogurt came out. Some believe that it was originally going to be called Flan. It featured USB tethering and WiFi hotspot functionality, as well as support for numeric and alphanumeric passwords.
        
        Then, in late 2010, we saw Android 2.3 Gingerbread with copy-paste functionality, support for NFC and multiple cameras on a single device.
        
        The first Android release focused on tablets was Android 3.0 Honeycomb, released in early 2011. It had a redesign, with a holographic-like interface. Its system bar merged the navigation buttons and the status bar. Even though this version was made only for tablets, some people have gotten it to work on a Nexus One, that was a phone.
        
        Some refinements were made with 3.1 and 3.2, like adding USB connectivity, support for joysticks and gamepads and increased the compatibility with more devices.
        
        The next year, 2011, Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich was announced, with the new Roboto font, hardware acceleration and resizable widgets.
        
        Succeeded in 2012 by Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. Phones running this version were now able to use Android Beam. Overall, it received many improvements to the speed of the OS. It is rumored that the beta name for this version was Jandy Cane.
        
        4.2 and 4.3 were minor updates to Jelly Bean that added features like gesture typing, SELinux, OpenGL 3 and 4K resolution support.
        
        The following major release was in 2013, with Android 4.4 KitKat. Originally named Key Lime Pie. It now required less RAM, showed a full screen artwork when the device is locked and implemented Immersive mode, that disables the system and status bars. It is the oldest Android version Google encourages developers to support.
        
        2014’s Android 5.0 and 5.1 Lollipop, internally codenamed Lemon Meringue Pie, simplified the three navigation buttons to the simple shapes we now know. It was the first version to implement Material Design, with a card based UI.
        
        2015 would see the creation of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, internally codenamed as Macadamia Nut Cookie. It introduced a new feature called Doze, that will turn Android apps off if the device has not been moving for some time to save battery. It now allowed you to use Android Pay and USB C connections.
        
        We are getting close to modern Android, with 2016’s Android 7.0 and 7.1 Nougat, internally codenamed as New York Cheesecake. It featured a native split-screen mode and a data saver.
        
        Moving on with the 2017 release, Android 8.0 and 8.1 Oreo, with the internal codename of Oatmeal Cookie. It added a native picture in picture mode, notification snoozing and notification channels.
        
        In 2018, we would get Android 9 Pie, internally codenamed as Pistachio Ice Cream. It revamped the quick settings menu and the traditional navigation system with the Two Button navigation, that used one button to go to the home screen, and swiping that same button would get you to the Overview. When necessary, the back button would appear.
        
        The following year, 2019, Android 10 would come out, officially dropping the dessert names, but they are still used internally, so it is Android 10: Queen Cake or Quince Tart. It was the base for modern Android, with very important additions like the gesture navigation and system wide dark theme.
        
        2020’s release: Android 11 Red Velvet Cake would focus more on improving the system, with a new power menu that combined the power options, home controls and Google Pay and merged the media player with the Quick Settings panel. We also got finally a native screen recorder.
        
        For 2021, we got one of the biggest updates in the entire history of Android with Android 12, introducing an updated design language called Material You, Universal device search and a Gaming Dashboard.
        
        We also saw the first tablet focused update in a long time, with Android 12L or 12.1, that added a taskbar and improved large devices support.
        
        With this in mind, it was not really a surprise to see that the 2022 update, Android 13 Tiramisu was not that big, including a new Photo picker and enhancements to Material You, like the new progress bars and themed icons support for third party apps.
        
        As a fun fact, if you have not noticed the pattern, the letters follow the alphabetical order. So next year’s release will be Android 14 U, rumored to be codenamed as Upside Down Cake. I’m already planning a concept video for it, so stay tuned for that.

        As I mentioned in the beginning of the video, Android is not only an OS for smartphones, as it can run on smart devices too. 
        
        For TVs, we have Android TV, that optimizes its resources and UI to be better experienced with a remote. Most TVs already come with it preinstalled, but for those that don’t, there are usually sticks or boxes that connect to your HDMI input connection and convert it into a smart device with Android. One person that I know got one of these boxes, but instead of running Android TV, it ran just Android with a custom launcher, so it was interesting to know that it recognized the box as if it was a tablet, and if you were wondering, yes, you could sideload apps, and because it is Android, you could technically also run Android TV apps on your phone, but they obviously won’t be properly optimized for it.
        
        Speaking about smartwatches, let’s introduce Android Wear, now just called WearOS. It really hasn’t been that popular comparing it to Apple’s watchOS, but they both share the goal of making a watch more connected and useful. You can install apps to it if they support it, and it basically behaves as an extension of your phone. With the new version of wearOS and the Pixel Watch, people expect this OS to finally be more mainstream, but we’ll see.
        
        Finally, let’s mention Android Auto. It is a mode that gets activated when you connect with a cable or wirelessly your phone to your supported car. You will be able to control stuff like the music that is playing, the GPS navigation and reply to messages through Google Assistant. It tries to be useful, but avoiding being distracting.

        It surprises me that the Android community doesn’t seem to have a lot of memes compared to the Linux community, but it does have some.
        
        Probably, the most popular one is very relatable, as we all have faced an ad of some mobile game or app whose “X” is just too small or it is just a fake one. This is done on purpose to increase the chances of us going to their Play Store page, and most of the times, they achieve it. I think it only hurts its reputation, but well.
        
        Next, we have the “Android camera quality” memes. That basically bash Android users for supposedly having inferior cameras to the iPhones. I mean, they probably meant Android users with a low end device, because if we compare the flagship Android cameras, they really don’t look any worse than what Apple has to offer. They are right in some way, as Android’s cameras tend to look worse in third party apps, but that deserves its own entry.
        
        Let me tell you about the next meme, it’s just one sentence: “Galaxy Nexus: Android Ice Cream Sandwich Guinea Pig”. If you didn’t get it, which is very likely, it was the confusing headline of a Cnet review article for the Galaxy Nexus phone, implying that it was sort of a test device for Android Ice Cream Sandwich.
        
        “Claim an Android version before someone else takes it” was a TikTok trend where people would do the thing previously mentioned with a random video. Not much to add.
        
        “Adrod 13 Installer” was another meme TikTok trend where people would show a suspicious low quality android 13 Installer, and when they pressed on the Install button, their device would get bricked.
        
        Finally, we have the Wii Phone. This was taken from a video from 2008 that showed next gen concepts for next generation consoles. One of them was the “Wii Phone”. The video now just screams late 2000’s with the PowerPoint presentation style, Comic Sans font and the music. That is why it became a meme, and someone actually made a Wii Phone themed app, making the Wii Phone a real thing.

        Samsung released the Galaxy Note 7 back on August 19th, 2016. It was the successor to the Galaxy Note 5, with features like expandable storage, IP68 water resistance, a curved display, a stylus and it was powered by an octa core Exynos 8890, with 4GB of RAM. A good phone back then, but it had one big issue: The battery. More specifically, there wasn’t enough room between the heat sealed protective pouch around the battery and its internals, that could cause electrodes inside each battery to crimp. This, along with having thin separators, increased the risks of separator damage and short circuit. It led to some batteries overheating, setting on fire and exploding.
        
        Airports and other places started banning these phones, as they could cause some accident, and until today, it is remembered as one of the biggest Samsung failures.

        The official way of installing an Android app is by downloading it from the Google Play Store. However, sometimes, the app that you’re looking for is not on the Play Store, as it could have been removed, doesn’t follow the Play Store guidelines or was never there to begin with. That is why some users opt for sideloading apps. The most popular and easiest method is by installing the apk file. There are several sites that can help us to get these apks. Some are safe and legal, like APKPure and APKMirror, others that I have not tried, like Aptoide, but there are some sketchy ones that allegedly allow you to install paid apps for free, but as you can imagine, some of them include viruses, so I do not recommend installing from these. 
        
        Some of these sites also offer the App Bundle version from a program. These are the new packaging format recently introduced and now enforced to the new Play Store uploads. APK’s contain everything an app has, for example: Layouts for large screens, all translations and exclusive content for some devices. This makes them a little bit bloated, as they include stuff that you don’t really need. 
        
        App Bundles, with the aab extension try to solve this by only including stuff that your device does need. So instead of including all translations and layouts, it only includes instructions, in the form of Split APKs, to build and optimized APK that only has your languages and your screen resolution, saving storage. However, this usually makes them a little more tedious to install, because you need a specific app to handle Split APKs.
        
        There are some apps that really can’t be installed easily, and the only way to do so is to force install it or even decompile it

        Before smartphones, foldable dumb phones or flip phones were very common. Companies now started to look back, and thought that bringing them back could offer some good advantages, like having a tablet sized device fold in half to turn it into a normal sized phone, or having a normal sized phone turn into a very little thing that fits easily in your pocket.
        
        But how would you make a modern phone, whose front screen is made entirely with glass fold? I mean, like Zack says: “Glass is glass, and glass breaks”. Well, foldable phones work with a plastic screen, that even if it is way less resistant, it can fold in half. 
        
        Samsung is one of the pioneers of this type of phones, with its Galaxy Fold and Flip series, that have been the most successful devices of its kind. But we also have some other brands that have tried it too, like Motorola with its Razr or my favorite implementation, the Oppo Find N, that is more of a squared device, which makes it reachable when not folded, and has also a good tablet aspect ratio when unfolded.
        
        Some believe that these phones could be the future, but for now, it seems a little bit hard. It’s new technology, so it’s expensive and has a lot of room for improvement. But we’ll see.

        A navigation method lets you control the three basic Android actions: Go back, Go home or see the Overview menu with all your apps. Originally, there were more buttons on Android phones, but they became irrelevant, and the three button navigation remained, only switching from physical to capacitive and then, digital buttons.
        
        With Android 9 Pie, Google introduced the Two button navigation, that is an in-between the three button navigation an the gesture navigation. You just have one button, if you tap it, you go home, if you swipe up, it shows you the Overview, and if it’s possible to go back, a back arrow will appear on the left.
        
        In the next OS update, the full gesture navigation was included, now allowing you to swipe up to go home, swipe up and hold to go to the overview and swiping from the left or right edge to go back. 
        
        Most people I’ve seen use the gesture navigation now, and I prefer it too, but there are people that also prefer other navigation methods.

        Desktop mode is a feature that some phones have, that allows you to connect your phone with a USB C to HDMI cable to a monitor. The UI will adapt itself to this bigger screen size, and you will get features like floating windows or a taskbar.
        
        In the stock version of Android, we have a weird, very barebones version of this mode, introduced with Android 10. The thing was very hidden, but it shows you an app drawer and allows you to have multiple floating windows. To enable it, you have to go to developer options and scroll down until you reach the Apps section. You have to enable freeform windows and force desktop mode. Still, I would recommend you to use a custom launcher that supports better this mode.
        
        The first phone to have a proper desktop mode was the Motorola Atrix, that could connect to a LapDock, that is basically a laptop without a processor, powered by the phone itself.
        
        The most popular implementation of the desktop mode is definitely Samsung Dex, built into OneUI, even though it is exclusive to some phones, it is very complete, allowing you to have a Start Menu, taskbar and floating apps.
        
        Other brands have made their own implementations, like Huawei’s Easy Projection, Motorola’s Ready for PC, Oxi Rom’s desktop mode, Xiaomi’s MIUI+ and LG’s implementation.
        
        If your OEM does not have this feature, you could try using Sentio Desktop, an app that tries to achieve the same thing.

        In mid 2021, these unofficial renders made by Lightfarm of a girl promoting Samsung products called “Samantha” went viral. The internet was attracted to her, and a lot of fan art as well as misinformation started to appear, thinking that she was going to eventually replace Samsung’s official virtual assistant: Bixby. But no, the truth is that these are not official renders, they are only concepts of how a virtual assistant could look like in human form.
        
        I really do wonder why Samsung didn’t follow the trend and made her an official character or something. It would have been just good marketing.

        Android is technically open source, but Google manages to make life living hell for those that try to make an Android fork, and with that term I’m referring to modifications to Android that go beyond being a commercial Google Play Services compliant skin that adds UI tweaks and a few features. Custom Roms have their own entry, so we’ll talk about them later. I’m referring to OSes that have tried to create their own ecosystems, ditching Google’s, with the only thing in common being that they’re based on Android.
        
        First, we have Amazon’s FireOS, that as you know, does not have GMS, so they had to build their own Amazon Services. Instead of Google Maps, you have Amazon Maps, replacing Firebase Cloud Messaging, you have Amazon Device Messaging; Google Play In App Billing is replaced with Amazon In App Purchasing API and so on.
        
        The different launcher is the first thing you notice, with tabs for your different programs, but also for your media library, promoting services like Prime Video, Amazon Music and Amazon Shopping.
        
        This OS is only available for Fire Tablets only sold by Amazon, and for Fire TV Boxes, but it’s one of the two most popular forks of Android.
        
        The second popular and commercial fork is HarmonyOS. After being banned from selling products and collaborating with companies in the US, Huawei had to develop its own OS. Of course, because AOSP can be used by anyone, bypassing the US ban, the chinese company took it as its base, with the only issue being that it didn’t have GMS. Not a big issue in China, as they don’t use them there anyway, but it was truly one for the rest of the world. So they developed Huawei Mobile Services, that include the AppGallery, Petal Maps and Search, Mobile Cloud, the Huawei ID, Music and Themes. As the name implies, it tries to harmonically connect your smart devices. It was shipped at first in Honor Smart TVs, but later, it arrived to smartphones, tablets and smartwatches. In smartphones and tablets, it looks very, very similar to iOS.
        
        These two previously mentioned brands have had moderate success with their forks, but the next one we’ll talk about is not trying to be commercial at all, in fact, its goal is to remain 100% open source. Licensed under the GPL and sponsored by the FSF itself, ReplicantOS is an Android fork that tries to remove all proprietary bits from the AOSP code. Its latest release is based on LineageOS 13 that builds upon Android 6, so it looks dated, but it is not trying to appeal to everyone. The project is still alive and well, and looks like the next release will be ReplicantOS 10, based on LineageOS 17, that uses Android 10 as its base. If your phone is compatible with LineageOS, chances are that it is also compatible with Replicant.

        It is very likely that your phone hasn’t gotten the latest version: Android 13, that is if it is going to get it at all.
        
        Fragmentation in Android is very bad, but is not the only reason why Android sucks when it comes to updates. As we’ve seen before, OEMs usually apply their own skin on top of stock Android. They have their own way of implementing their features and modifying how they look. This is one of the reasons why it usually takes so long to get an update, because they don’t ship Android as is, they have to make sure it looks and behaves how they want, and also, they have to get rid of the bugs and make their newer devices compatible. Sometimes, the update has to go through AOSP, then, your OEM, next, your carrier and finally, it arrives to your device. Usually, 6 months later, but if your phone is a low-end device, you can expect less and slower updates. OEMs don’t really get anything from updating phones for several years. They’d rather make your phone lose support and force you to buy another one. 
        
        The phones that have the best update support are the Google Pixel phones, but chances are that you don’t have one of these, as they don’t sell them worldwide.
        
        This is why, there is always a 1 year gap between your version and the actual latest version of the OS. StatCounter shows us that most people are still running Android 11. This is a striking contrast with iOS, with the majority of the phones running the latest version.
        
        ## Androids’ cameras suck in third party apps

        If you’ve used Android and iOS, you might know that usually, the camera quality in Android phones is worse in third party apps compared to the quality iPhones have. This is because there are a few amount of iPhones, and apps like Instagram or Snapchat can optimize easier these cameras because they don’t have a huge amount of combinations of sensors, lenses and other specifications. 
        
        Samsung has partnered with Snapchat and other developers to optimize the Galaxy S21’s cameras better, and it seems like people are satisfied with the result. 
        
        Google tried to fix this still present issue with the CameraX API, but we’ll probably have to wait until all developers start using it until we can have better quality in third party apps.

        MIUI has its own implementation, with Super Wallpapers, that are wallpapers usually of planets, that zoom in and out when you unlock your phone.
        
        I think they are kind of a gimmick. I personally don’t use them, as you can really feel your phone getting slower and draining more battery. It could also be distracting.

        In the Play Store, you can find Icon Packs, that replace your stock icons with the ones that you like the most. Some are free, and some are paid, but recently, Google introduced themed icons for third party apps, that is a standardized way of having simple icons that follow your theme.
        
        To use a custom icon pack, you usually have to have a custom launcher.

        A launcher is a program that takes care of your home screen’s design and features. You can install different launchers and switch between them if you’re not satisfied with your stock launcher.
        
        Most launchers are based on AOSP’s Launcher2 or Launcher3, that are open source barebones launchers that can be modified to make a more complete version. 
        
        This is the case of Nova Launcher, known for being the most customizable launcher available. You can modify everything, from the grid of your home screen, to the badges on your app icons. It offers a limited free version, but buying the full version is almost a must for people that love to customize every aspect of their phone.
        
        If you prefer a more vanilla launcher with a few nice additional features, you have Lawnchair, that currently is still in its Android 12 Beta, but should bring some really cool features like themed icons for all apps even if you don’t have Android 13.
        
        Another popular launcher is the Microsoft Launcher, that has its own design including its own feed that lets you check a summarized version of your upcoming events and screentime, as well as your news and your timeline.
        
        Then, we have the Smart Launcher that automatically organizes your apps in categories, allows you to have grid-less widgets and to customize it however you want.
        
        Finally, the AIO Launcher tries to show you only a single home screen, with a lot of important info, like your frequent apps, timers and a system monitor. 
        
        I would probably use Lawnchair, but I hate the fact that gesture navigation support for third party launchers is still very hit or miss. It used to work when I had my Motorola phone, but with my Redmi Note 10 Pro, it gives me a very annoying warning when I try to enable it.

            [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboto)
            
        
        Droid Sans is the first font made for Android. It was created in 2007 by Ascender Corporation and it is licensed under the Apache License. Its main goal is to try to stay clear on screens of small phones. 
        
        There are three variations: Droid Serif,
        
        Droid Sans
        
        and Droid Sans Mono.
        
        In 2011, with the release of Ice Cream Sandwich, a new default font for the system was created, called Roboto. This one is also licensed under the Apache license.
        
        In Lollipop, Roboto got redesigned, changing some little details like replacing the punctuation marks on letters from squared to rounded. There are a couple of variations for this font, like Roboto Slab,
        
        and Roboto Mono.
        
        There are some Android skins that allow you to change your default system font, but for the ones that don’t, you'll usually have to root your phone to be able to do so.
        
        ## Developer options
        
        The developer options are a series of hidden settings that allow you access to more advanced features that usually would be useful to a developer, but sometimes they can also be useful to normal users.
        
        To enable them, you have to go to the Settings app, 
        
        Scroll to the bottom
        
        Tap on “About device”
        
        Scroll to the bottom again and tap 7 times on the Build number
        
        Now, you’ve unlocked the developer Settings
        
        Go back 
        
        Tap on “System”
        
        Developer options
        
        And there they are
        
        I will only mention the ones that I think are the most useful ones for normal users, power users and developers.
        
        The first one is under Debugging, and is USB Debugging, to use ADB and Debugging mode for an app.
        
        In that same section, we have Show refresh rate, if you’re not sure if your phone has that feature enabled by default.
        
        You can choose to enable Mac address randomization, if you want to avoid getting tracked with your Mac address.
        
        Under Networking, you can choose the default USB configuration that you want to use when you connect your phone to a computer. This is useful to set transferring files as the default behavior to not have to select it every time
        
        Under Drawing, you can select the speed for different animations.
        
        In hardware accelerated rendering, you can toggle override force dark to force apps with a light theme to have a dark one.
        
        Finally, if you want the desktop mode we showed you earlier, you can toggle it under Apps.
        
        You can always disable and re enable the developer options.

        Material Design is a series of guidelines and UI API’s Google provides, expecting apps to implement them and follow Android’s current design and human interface guidelines.
        
        The first version was introduced with Android 5 Lollipop, and some components have been added over time, like the bottom app bar. But the biggest redesign to it came with Android 12, and it is called Material Design 3, or Material You. The main feature is that all the components adapt themselves to your device’s accent color, that is taken from your wallpaper, and also, they improved support for large devices.
        
        I really like it, but let’s be real. Most phone brands and apps value more their own aesthetic, so most of them won’t implement it at all.

        Android apps or the OS itself can run on other devices that originally didn’t run it. Let’s begin with the ways to run these apps on your desktop.
        
        ChromeOS by default has been able to run Android apps without much trouble and with functioning Play Services for quite some time now. You just have to download them from the Play Store.
        
        However, if you have Windows, you can try using Windows 11’s Windows Subsystem for Android. For now, it is limited to only some countries and you’re limited to Amazon apps, but you always have the option to sideload APK’s. Of course, this approach does not have GMS, even though it’s possible to install them jumping through some hoops. 
        
        If not having Google Services is a deal breaker for you, then, you could try BlueStacks. It is an emulator that includes them, and is mainly focused on playing Android games on your Windows machine, so it’s probably the most reliable option.
        
        If you use Linux, you have a couple of options: Anbox, which is not an emulator, but a container, making it faster and integrating it well with your applications. To install it, you have to get the snap package.
        
        There’s another alternative called Waydroid, that is also a container, a LineageOS one to be exact, but seems to be an improved version of Anbox. It does require you to be using Wayland on your system, though, so if you don’t have it, it won’t work, and it seems to be a little harder to set up. 
        
        I have to mention that none of these options for Linux include GMS, but it is possible to sideload them.
        
        Because they are compatible with a Linux system, that means that Linux phones like the PinePhone can run Android apps too, and that is one of the things that Linux phone enthusiasts hope will improve, so people can switch to them.
        
        What about running Android apps on iOS? Well, if you have a fake iPhone, you are most likely already able to run them, as some of these run a heavily customized version of Google’s OS. One time, a couple of sellers tried to persuade me to buy them a fake Golden iPhone X that was obviously running Android, but that is an anecdote that I could tell you in another video, if you want.
        
        Now, seriously, people have managed to make Android run on iOS with Project Sandcastle, that uses the Linux kernel and modifies it as well as other elements to be able to run Bugdroid’s OS.
        
        Open iBoot achieves the same thing but with a different approach, making an open source implementation of Apple’s closed source bootloader: iBoot. This allows you to boot unsigned code like Android on iPhones.
        
        You also have ACL for Tizen, that supposedly lets you run Android apps on Tizen, but I have never seen it actually working, and download sites seem suspicious.
        
        For Windows Phone, Microsoft was actually developing a way of being be able to run Android apps, called Project Astoria, but it was cancelled, so there’s not an official way of doing it for this platform.
        
        ## Android Malware

        The most popular OS is definitely going to be the main target for several malware, as it is our most personal device. There are different types of viruses, like adware, that shows you intrusive ads in certain parts of the system to make money; Spyware, that spies on your personal information like contacts, photos and even bank accounts and Trojans, that are quiet viruses that hide themselves very well and do some suspicious activity in the background.  
        
        One of these Trojans was Dendroid, discovered first in 2014, it was capable of deleting call logs, opening web pages, dialing numbers, recording calls, opening apps and performing denial-of-service attacks. The code leaked, and that’s how we know that it had a way of binding Dendroid to legitimate apps.
        
        But sometimes, you don’t have to download something to be vulnerable. This was the case of the Dirty COW vulnerability, that stands for Dirty copy on write, and affected all Linux systems, and as we know, that includes Android devices with kernel versions created before 2018. It allowed the escalation of privileges, and having superuser permissions means that they can basically do whatever they want with your system, like installing a keylogger or running malicious code.
        
        One of the most popular Spyware programs is Pegasus. Developed by the Israeli cyber arms company: NSO Group. It can be installed on the two main mobile OSes, and it is capable of reading text messages, tracking calls, collecting passwords and performs location tracking.
        
        I would recommend you to always keep your phone up to date, as security patches fix vulnerabilities that can be exploited to harm or steal information from your device.
        
        We constantly get news about apps from the Official Play Store that were infected with malware, bypassing Google’s inspections and the Play Protect feature, so be careful when choosing what apps to install. Unfortunately, Google has made it harder to know if an app is potential malware by replacing the permissions section with the Data Safety section, but I’d say that if you only download very popular apps, and open source apps, you could be safe. Still, only grant the necessary permissions.
        
        ## AOSP

        AOSP stands for Android Open Source Project, and it is the base of all Android systems. You can get the open source code from the official website, and it is licensed under the Apache 2 License, so you can make closed source forks of it.
        
        If you use it, it will be a hard experience keeping in mind that it really is not optimized for your phone, so if you have a notch, it won’t support it properly. It doesn’t have Play Services or a browser that allows you to download stuff as well, so the whole experience could be described as “Raw”. 
        
        You are seeing how it looks like right now, and you might have already noticed that there are some very ancient apps here, as Google doesn’t care about the AOSP apps because they have replaced them with their proprietary versions, but that is an interesting topic that deserves its own video that I’m already working on.

        The Android Debug Bridge is a command line tool that allows your phone to connect to a computer with a cable or wirelessly if you have a phone that runs Android 11 or above and perform different commands with the purpose of debugging an app or modding your phone.
        
        To use it, you have to have a Windows, Mac or Linux computer and download the SDK Platform Tools from the official website, then, enable USB Debugging under Developer options in the Settings app, next, connect your phone with a cable to your PC and finally, open a terminal in the location where you have the SDK Tools.
        
        I’m going to mention the most common commands.
        
        We begin with adb devices, that is usually the first command that you’ll run to see what devices are connected, and if the connection is working.
        
        adb pull allows you to get a file from your phone to your pc, and adb push does the opposite, uploading a file from your PC to your phone.
        
        First, you always type “adb”, if you have multiple devices, next, you type dash s and the name of the device, then, the command, the path that we’re getting that file from and the path that we want to upload that file to in our pc. If it says that one file was pulled, we executed the command successfully. 
        
        Now, let’s try with adb push. The syntax is very similar, but the parameters will be reversed, so after push, you type the path to your file from your PC, and then, where you want to send it to in your phone. You should see a message telling you that the file was pushed.
        
        Now, the next command is adb shell, that lets us control our phone via a terminal, so if you already know a little about bash, this will be familiar to you. We’ll control our phone to see the file that we exported to it from our computer. 
        
        The first part of the syntax is the same, just type “adb”, and select your device, then, “shell”. If this operation was successful, you are going to see the name of your phone and a dollar sign, indicating that we’re a normal user. Use the command “cd”, standing for “change directory” and as an argument, type the path where your file is located at. Execute the command “ls” that means list to see the files in that directory, and you should see our exported file.
        
        To exit the shell mode, type “exit”.
        
        Now, we’re going to execute the command “adb logcat”, that lets us see all the logs that apps send to us. This is useful mainly to see if some line of code from your app did run. To cancel keep seeing the logcat, press Control and C.
        
        Finally, to reboot your device, just run “adb reboot”.
        
        ADB has had a couple of easter eggs, for example, if you ran “adb hell”, instead of adb shell, you would get a red and yellow terminal text and highlight colors, but the command would work the same way. Seems like this has been removed, though.
        
        You can execute adb lolcat instead of adb logcat, and it will still work. Typing adb longcat will show you the logs, but in a different format.
        
        ## Android powered by Linux
        
        If you didn’t know, Android uses the Linux kernel, that is why, if you download a terminal emulator, you can execute some Linux commands, but not all of them, because Android doesn’t have the GNU Utilities.
        
        The system also shares some interesting characteristics, like using Mime types to guess what program to open a file, using a dot before a folder’s name to hide it and app package names.
        
        When you check the kernel version, that is the version of the Linux kernel that you’re using.

        XDA Developers is a tech news website, but they also have forums.

Also, in your phone’s dedicated subforum, you can find ROMs, Recoveries and more.

        Android has a similar filesystem to Linux. It all starts with the root directory. Under it, we have the read-only /system partition, that has system files for stuff like the GUI, preinstalled apps and it is basically the ROM of your phone. This partition gets overwritten whenever you get an update, but only if it is cryptographically signed by your OEM unless you unlock your bootloader.
        
        The /boot partition has the bootloader and the kernel. Without it, your phone won’t boot.
        
        /recovery is where your stock or custom recovery is installed. You can overwrite this partition with another custom recovery like TWRP.
        
        /data, that is where you can find your internal and external storage. Internal storage means the data that apps create, and that is intended to only be accessed by the app that created it, not by the user unless they root. For example, think of your progress files from an offline game.
        
        External storage, however, refers to the part of the filesystem that the user is intended to use for storing and modifying their files, storing directories like Documents, Downloads, Music, DCIM, where you will find your taken photos, Android, where apps store their public data and Pictures. This location is known as /storage/emulated/0 or /sdcard, that is a link to the first one mentioned. The “0” in the path is some sort of ID for the default user, but if you created more users, it will change according to them, having another number instead.
        
        Under /data, as external storage, you can also find your external removable storage, like an SD Card or a USB at. That is if you choose to use it in portable mode, that behaves like its own entity, similar to how it works when you use external storage on a computer.
        
        If you decide to use the adoptable mode instead, it will fuse the removable SD Card with your internal storage, meaning that you will only get more storage and it will be seen as one entity, but if you remove the removable device, apps will start to fail and files will go missing. 
        
        When you format your phone, the only thing that gets wiped is the data partition.
        
        /cache is where important and frequently accessed data will be
        
        And in /misc, is where other stuff is stored, like the carrier or region ID.

        An activity is basically a fullscreen page that displays content, and that is what Android apps are made of. They can also be presented as floating windows. 
        
        Activities can overlap previous ones, but these last ones can still be retained in memory. A very good example of this is when you’re going through submenus in the Settings app.
        
        An activity has four states:
        
        The first one is when it is active, that means that it is the one that the user is currently interacting with, and is at the highest position of the stack.
        
        If the activity has lost focus but is still shown, its state is visible. In this case, the activity maintains its state and information, as well as remaining attached to the window manager.
        
        If an activity is obscured by another one, then, it is Stopped. It retains all information, but could be killed by the system when memory is needed.
        
        When the system wants to kill an activity, then, its state is destroyed, and has to be loaded again if you display it to the user.

        The Android Manifest is an xml file that every app has, and that declares the most important things, like all the activities, services, broadcast receivers and content providers. Here, you can also find all the permissions the app needs as well as the name, icon and package of the app itself.

        The first commercial Android phone was the HTC Dream, also known as the T Mobile G1 in the US and some parts of Europe. 
        
        When Google acquired Android Inc back in 2005 to compete against Symbian and Windows Mobile it led to the creation of a prototype of the HTC Dream, codenamed as “Sooner”. It was a phone similar to a Blackberry, with small, non-touch screen, navigation keys and physical keyboard.
        
        When Apple announced the iPhone, they had to switch their focus, creating the device that we currently know. Android also adapted to this new vision, being officially unveiled in November of 2007.
        
        When it released, the reception was mixed, as everyone was comparing it to the original iPhone, and it couldn’t compete as well in some aspects, like media consumption, as Apple integrated its iPhone with iTunes. But in general, people were excited to see how Android improved, as it promised a new, open ecosystem contrasting to Apple’s iPhoneOS.

        In the anime Dragon Ball Z, there is a character called “Android 13”, which makes it very easy to get confused, not knowing if they mean Google’s OS or the character. This is very evident when looking for pictures, mainly, as both appear in the results.
        
        This is why, some people thought that Google would change the name of the latest iteration of Android to avoid the naming conflict, but it didn’t end up happening.

        It is somewhat known that because iPhones are very expensive and Android phones are usually cheaper, there are some Apple users that have some sort of elitism, and they pick on other phones’ users. This is obviously not the case for all people that use iPhone, it is just a vocal minority.
        
        Times of India published an article where, based on a 1500 people survey made by the company Declutter, they came up with the conclusion that most people would prefer to date an iPhone user over an Android user.
        
        Malta Daily did a similar thing, but based on a British dating app called POM, where 3000 people selected that something that would turn them off would be a person using an Android device.
        
        A very known controversy that for some of us feels like a first world problem is the Green VS Blue bubbles thing. If you didn’t know, most people in the US use iPhones, and for messaging, they use the default iMessage app that comes with it. Messages between iPhones and Apple devices are represented with a blue bubble. These ones, have exclusive proprietary features that Apple has included, and they’re better overall.
        
        In contrast, Android users’ messages are represented with a green bubble, that means that that message uses MMS, which is an old technology, that does not have read receipts, encryption, high res media sharing, and a lot of other features that we expect from a modern messaging app.
        
        RCS has all of these things, and is a standard that could improve compatibility between iPhones and Android’s Messages if Apple decided to support it, but if they did, all messages would have the same features regardless of what phone you have, making it easier for other people to switch to an Android phone.
        
        Google has tried to make Apple do something to fix it, but hasn’t achieved anything, and now, basically when everyone sees a green bubble, they know that person it’s using Android, and it’s common for some childish people to pick on other ones that do not have iPhones.

        In Unix-like systems such as Android there is a user called the SuperUser or just Root user, in reference to the fact that it is the only user that can affect the root file system. It has absolutely all permissions to do everything that is possible, from creating a normal file to deleting the entire system with a file explorer that lets you use these privileges, like Material Files. This is why, as a security measure, but also to lock down Android to an extent, the root user is disabled by default, and you cannot enable it unless you unlock your bootloader, which forces you to factory reset as well as rooting does, and you will lose your warranty.
        
        Programs like Magisk or SuperSu allow you to enable this root user and grant its permissions to apps, usually by patching the boot image. Some other programs like Kingo or King root allegedly allow you to root your phone with just one click, without having to unlock the bootloader nor using a computer. They seem very suspicious to me, but maybe they did actually work in the past, I just wasn’t using Android back then to confirm it, so please, let me know in the comments.  
        
        There are a couple of reasons why you would want to root your phone, like removing bloatware, customizing your phone’s UI or removing ads.
        
        There are also so called unrootable phones, or phones that are very hard to root, mainly because they don’t allow bootloader unlocking.
        
        On the opposite side, though, there have been reports of phones that actually have access to adb root because the OEM forgot to disable it.
        
        However, keep in mind that when rooting, some apps, specially, banking ones will detect it and won’t allow you to use them unless you use a Magisk module to hide it.

        A Custom ROM is an alternative operating system based on Android that can be installed on supported devices that have an unlocked bootloader. It is mainly useful to get another software if you don’t like the stock one, or if your phone won’t get any more updates, and you still wanna be up to date. 
        
        Some of these offer a very vanilla experience, in favor of better battery life and stability, sometimes allowing you to Degoogle the phone, like ArrowOS or the most popular ROM: LineageOS, that is the successor of CyanogenMod.
        
        Others provide a more complete experience with more features, like Pixel Experience, that tries to replicate the feeling of the Google Pixel phones.
        
        There are ROMs that focus on gaming and full customization, such as crDroid.
        
        Calyx and G OS are privacy and security focused ROMs, that make improvements to AOSP focused on the thing previously mentioned. For example, being degoogled, scrambling the passcode keypad and having a firewall.
        
        Most of these are open source, so you can contribute to them if you’d like. Keep in mind that individual developers work on them, not big corporations.
        
        Custom ROMs are usually device specific, so not all phones will be able to install one, but some projects publish a GSI, that stands for Generic System Image, basically allowing you to install it on all phones that support the Project Treble, which are most these days.
        
        The bad thing about these OSes is that in most cases, you lose support for the original camera app of the phone, so you will not be able to take full advantage of all the lenses. There are some exceptions, though, and it’s nice to see them.

        Starting with Android 12L, a new taskbar was introduced for large screen devices, that fuses together your favorite apps and the system navigation. It allows you to directly launch an app quickly or drag it to a side to open it in split screen.
        
        With this year’s update, a shortcut for the app drawer was also added to the taskbar, basically making it a start menu.
        
        If you don’t have these updates or a tablet, in the Google Play Store, there is an open source app called “Taskbar”, that lets you replicate some of this functionality, and is compatible with the hidden AOSP’s desktop mode.

        Android has been relying officially on the ARM architecture, as that is the one most phones these days have. However, there are some projects that take care of porting Android to the architecture that most PCs still have, and that is x86 or x64, meaning that you can install it on these devices. 
        
        Because the green OS supports mice, keyboards and a lot of other devices, it usually works very well on PCs. And I guess that the experience will be better when they support Android 12L, that improves a lot the UI and UX for large screen devices.
        
        Some of the reasons why you would want to to this could be to revive an old PC, to play mobile games in a big screen, with controllers or other peripherals; or also to make your own TV Box like we’ve seen before.
        
        If you’re interested, I will mention some OSes that allow you to do this, like RemixOS, PhoenixOS, PrimeOS, BlissOS and OpenTHOS.
        
        ## Android killed all Mobile OSes except iOS

            KaiOS

            [https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/12L/summary](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/12L/summary)
            
        
        Like it or not, today we just have two main mobile OSes: Android and iOS. These are the ones that survived the competition, which included some other software like Symbian, which became outdated; Windows Mobile; that lacked a lot of apps, mainly from Google, likely on purpose; Tizen, which I think nobody actually used and FirefoxOS, that was promising, but never caught on.
        
        I think that the reason of why they became mainstream was because iOS brought something new to the market, and Apple was already a big brand to back it up. Speaking about Android, I think it was because it was the first open source phone OS, which allowed a lot of brands to adopt it quickly.
        
        Currently, the only competition to these giants are Linux phones, like the PinePhone or Librem 5, but these are definitely not ready at all and still have a ton of issues, but it’s the best we got.
        
        You might have heard of KaiOS, but that one doesn’t really try to compete with Apple and Google’s creations. It is based on FirefoxOS, and its main goal is to try to make dumb phones a little more modern, but nothing more really.
        
        ## FairPhone
        
        Tired of disposable, quick and garbage phones that barely get any updates and just add up to the already huge amount of e-waste? Then, the FairPhone could be for you. It is built to be as sustainable, repairable and recyclable as possible. The latest iteration of the series is the FairPhone 4, that has 5G, a small notch, dual cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G and 128GB with 6GB of RAM.
        
        There are a couple of downsides, though. To begin with, the price is a little too expensive, but it could be totally justified to some of you: 580 euros. 
        
        Availability is also limited to some countries of the EU and the US.
        
        Also, its display is IPS running at 60Hz, which could be a deal breaker for some of you. Updates, even though guaranteed, are really slow. These phones still have Android 11.
        
        However, I still think that it’s nice to see something fresh in such a saturated market.

        This is a new open source operating system that Google has been developing for a while, and that we barely know anything about. It’s named after the color fuchsia, that is a combination of pink (which was the codename of Apple’s advanced Pink OS of the 90’s) and purple (also the codename of the first generation iPhone). So we can have an idea that Google is probably planning something big with this project.
        
        The company hasn’t said a lot about it, being the first time we knew about it in 2016, after media outlets reported a mysterious source code repository on GitHub. Inspection of the code suggested its capability of being able to run on multiple devices, like traffic lights, watches, phones, tablets and PCs.
        
        FuchsiaOS doesn’t have a Linux kernel like Android and ChromeOS do. It has its own one called “Zircon”, that is inspired by Unix kernels, but has some differences with them, like representing resources as objects instead of files.
        
        In 2021, thanks to a software update for the Google Nest Hub, its previous Chromecast-based software was reportedly replaced with FuchsiaOS, even though, there are no visual differences, so you wouldn’t even be able to tell.
        
        It is planned for Fuchsia to have something codenamed as “Starnix”, that would be a compatibility layer, making it able to run Android and Linux apps. Because of this, a lot of people think that this project could be not only a replacement for Android, but also for entire Linux based OSes in general. But again, this is only speculation.

        There have been multiple weird and interesting Android phones, for example: the LG Wing, that was a phone that had two screens, and the one on top could rotate, forming a “T” shape. This would be useful to play a video and have the screen on the bottom as a media controller, or to have a better gaming experience on games that supported it.
        
        Samsung made its own weird phones, like the Galaxy Beam, that had a projector, or the Galaxy Round that was, curved to be more comfortable to use, I guess. LG also made a curved phone called the LG G Flex, but the cool thing about it was that it could heal its own rear cover from minor scratches.
        
        The YotaPhone was a phone with an e-ink display on the back, which can be compared to what we now know as an Always On Display, but even more advanced, because you could interact with it.
        
        Asus made the PadFone, that was a phone that could be inserted into a tablet, and the phone would power it. 
        
        The Qoobex Qphone has an interesting feature: It allows you to see 3D content without glasses, as well as taking 3D photos and videos. It does cost 700 dollars, though.

        Similarly to Linux, Android has gone to space. A PCWorld report claims that in 2012, NASA was planning on sending miniature satellites constructed with Android powered Nexus One smartphones. But two years before, in 2010, Google sent seven payloads to space, to improve Google Maps and Google Sky Maps. They sent them with a Nexus S phone, that recorded the space along with a Bugdroid toy that was included.

        An article by Trusted Reviews says that Nintendo originally wanted to make a portable console (most likely the Switch) run a modified version of Android. They believe this because the executive chairman of CyanogenMod, Kirt McMaster published a now deleted tweet that claimed that in the early days of Cyanogen, Nintendo wanted them to make an OS for them, but they rejected them.
        
        It is believed that the Switch now runs a modified version of BSD with some Android code. But nothing is confirmed, of course.
        
        But you know the modding community: They always find a way. Achieving to make the Switch actually run Android 10, as you can see in this report by XDA Developers. It can even run some emulators.
        
        Speaking about consoles really running Android, you’ve probably heard of the OUYA. It was an Android console funded by Kickstarter, raising over 8 million dollars, but it ended up being a failure, discontinued two years after its release.
        
        ## Bricking

        If you flash a Custom ROM, Root or do any other modification to your phone improperly, you can get a series of errors. None of these are nice to see, and they can make you very worried.
        
        The least alarming error you can get is a bootstuck or bootloop. This makes your phone boot, but never go past certain point, usually, the boot animation. In other cases, it keeps rebooting, but never boots to the system. It’s normal for your phone to take a couple of minutes to boot the first time you install a new ROM, so I would only worry if you see that it’s taking more than 10 minutes.
        
        This is also known as soft bricking, meaning that your phone is useless because it doesn’t have a system, but can be fixed by flashing another one from the recovery.
        
        However, the one that I hope you never experience is a hard brick, where usually, some core component like the kernel or the boot partition got damaged, not even allowing you to boot into fastboot or the recovery, making it as useful as a brick, and can’t be recovered from that state.
        
        ## Degoogling

        Degoogling is the process of removing the Google Play Services and any Google app from your phone. This can be done easily by installing a Custom ROM that doesn't include them, with what it's usually called a vanilla build. You can find these on some ROMs like LineageOS or ArrowOS.
        
        Keep in mind that, as we mentioned before, a lot of third party apps also depend on GMS, so they will stop working, or have a limited functionality without these libraries. For example, Uber doesn’t work, because it uses the Maps API. Anything with In App Purchases won’t work either, and apps that use Firebase to send notifications won’t ever send them.
        
        But if you’d like a middle ground, there is something called MicroG. This is an open source GMS spoofer, that lets you have some more functionality, while keeping your privacy and most of the benefits of doing the practice mentioned in this entry. Even though, I would not recommend you to link your Google account to MicroG, as it is said that if the company detects you’re using it, it can terminate your account.
        
        You can also use a Play Store alternative called Aurora Store, that has literally the same apps, but allows you to download them without the need of signing in. 
        
        There is an app called Plexus. It shows you a database of apps, ranking them with two values according to how well they work without the services and how well they work with MicroG. It is very similar to something like ProtonDB.
        
        Sounds like such a pain and a big sacrifice, so why would you want to do this? Well, there are some pretty good reasons, actually. Because you have no Play Services, you can be sure that there is no tracking, as Google doesn’t include that at the AOSP level because if it did, it would have to be open source. Not having them also means a performance and battery improvement. I’ve heard that battery life doubles in Degoogled phones, but I cannot confirm it. Also, you won’t see any ad powered by the Alphabet’s company in your apps.

        There are terminal emulators for Android, being the most popular one the open source Termux, that allows you to execute some commands, install packages and is mainly useful if you have root, as some Magisk modules don’t have a UI and to set them up, you need to use the CLI.
        
        ## Android users vulnerable to AirTag stalking

        Apple recently started selling a new product called the AirTag. Its purpose is to track objects that could easily get lost or robbed. It is different from your usual tracker because every Apple device contributes to a network that reports the last location of your AirTags, making it very effective in a country like the US, where most people use iPhones.
        
        People with bad intentions knew that they could probably use these tags to track people down, but iPhones will show an alert if they detect that an AirTag has been near for too long. This is not the case with Android phones. Yes, Apple did release an app for Android that does the same thing, but the main issue is that this app does not work in the background, so you have to manually look for them, making people without iPhones more vulnerable to this risk.

        Because Android is free to use, anyone can make a very cheap phone running it. You can find some on Amazon, mainly from brands like Blu or Alcatel. Some of these even cost 30 dollars.
        
        However, there are always cheap clones of phones, usually on Wish.com, like the ones you’re seeing right now, made to fool people into thinking they're buying a flagship, using very similar names, but you'll notice it's fake when you start seeing the specs.

        There are phones that include infrared sensors. Most Xiaomi phones still do. This can be useful to control your smart devices or your TV, but to be honest, I’ve never used it, even when my phone has it.

        This is a feature available in some skins that allows you to have the same apps, but several times, each one having their own data. In MIUI, this is called Dual apps.
        
        This is useful, for example, when you want to have multiple profiles on a social media, or you want to have different save files in games.
        
        If your skin doesn’t support this, there are other alternative ways of doing it, like with this app called “App Cloner”, that does the same thing.
        
        But some people probably didn’t know that you can actually do this in stock Android without any third party apps, by just creating another user account. It will have their own apps, data, wallpaper and everything.
        
        ## Android design eras

        Like with every UI, the green OS has had a couple of design eras that follow the trends of different times.
        
        A channel that I found while making this video called Undefined made a great video about it. I’m going to summarize their work, but I recommend you to go and check it. It’s criminally underrated. This was not sponsored, by the way. I have like 2000 subs, so it wouldn’t even be worth it.
        
        They propose 6 eras of the UI design. Starting with the primitive era, between 2008 and 9. Including 1.0, Cupcake and Donut. It can be described as having a detailed and cartoonish style. But it was very inconsistent, as some apps had a dark or light theme without any standard.
        
        Comprised of Eclair, Froyo and Gingerbread, we have the Pre-Holo era, that is an in-between the previous one and the Holo era. Mixing some elements of the Primitive era, but simplifying a lot of icons and making it more consistent.
        
        Moving on with the Holo era, that features Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean and KitKat. Thanks to Project Butter, the smoothness and usability of the OS improved a lot. Things got cleaned up and a dark theme was standardized for all system apps. KitKat changes things a little bit, mainly making them brighter.
        
        Next, the Papercut era with Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat. It flattened all the icons, added drop shadows, pointed corners and floating buttons, thanks to the introduction of the first Material Design.
        
        Oreo started the “No Frills” or “Clean” era, that finished with Android 11. It focuses on practicality and cleaner, more rounded looks.
        
        The latest one, introduced with Android 12, was the Material You era, that based everything on the color of your wallpaper, adapting all the apps that support it to a new palette each time you change it. It is way more rounded, but also has some other interesting shapes. Even though, I think that it wastes space in some elements.

        In early 2020, this picture became viral, but not for good reasons, as it was crashing or even soft bricking Android phones that ran Android 10 or below. Why? Well, turns out that Android uses the SRGB format, but this image uses RGB, which Android fails to convert to SRGB. Something caused accidentally by the photographer, as they edited the photo on Lightroom, and used it on their iPhone, so they never found out about it until it became viral. 
        
        Setting this as your lock screen’s wallpaper will cause your phone to crash every time that you see it, and that will provoke a bootloop.
        
        Seeing the image and downloading it won’t cause anything, only setting it as your wallpaper will. It has been fixed with Android 11, but don’t ever try to do it if you’re on a previous version.
        
        ## Lucky Patcher
        
        It’s an app that requires root privileges, that claims to be able to unlock locked content from an app or game, get In App Purchases as well as paid apps for free and block ads from applications.
        
        I don’t think this is very legal, so I would not recommend you to use it. Also, because if Google finds out that you use it, it can terminate your account.

        There are a lot of Android modes, but the main ones, or the ones that most phones have are the bootloader or fastboot mode, that lets you boot to the system or to the recovery, and also to flash stuff, but only with ADB. In Xiaomi devices, this mode has a bunny, that is its mascot. If you boot to the recovery, you will be able to wipe the data of your phone, and if you use a custom recovery, you can flash ROMs or other things without the need of using ADB and a computer. 
        
        If you decide to boot to the system instead, depending on your phone, if you hold down the volume down button, you will boot into Safe mode, that will only include the apps that originally came with your phone. This is useful if you have a third party app that is causing your system to fail.
        
        There are more obscure modes, usually exclusive to certain companies like Motorola, that is the king of these modes. I will only mention them quickly, as they tend to be very similar:
        
        Starting with Upload, Ramdump and crash mode, that is basically a kernel panic screen, like Unix systems’ BSOD.
        
        In Lenovo, Motorola and LG phones, there’s the Factory mode, that lets you test how well the hardware is working.
        
        Lenovo and Motorola again have the Meta mode, that allows a phone to update or reinstall software, but some people say it’s just fastboot.
        
        For Samsung products, you have the maintenance mode, making you able to to choose between the bootloader, recovery, safe mode and factory reset. Also, the download mode, that is like fastboot, but without the ability of executing commands, and only being able to flash with a specific manufacturer tool like Odin.
        
        In some Pixel phones, Since Android 10, you get the Rescue mode, that surprisingly, it isn’t very clear what it is for. It only says that it’s waiting for rescue commands, but it seems to be made for technicians to be able to repair a phone, registering new parts with commands or something like that.
        
        Finally, meet the Qualcomm EDL Mode, that is used to flash ROMs via a special tool. You cannot modify this mode, having to physically open the phone to fix a brick. Forensic companies discovered a vulnerability in the mode that let them extract data from locked screens.

        Using software like Andronix, you can install a Linux distro on your phone without the need of having to root, even though, if you do have it, you can install Kali Linux for educational penetration testing. If you wish to do so, you can completely replace Android with Linux by installing Ubuntu Touch, if your phone is supported.
        
        Thanks to Android 13’s improved virtualization support, twitter user @kdrag0n was able to run Windows 11 on their Pixel 6. Interestingly, it seemed to adapt fine to the phone’s resolution, but it was barely functional, due to the lack of hardware acceleration.

        When your Android phone gets stolen, one of the first things the thief will do is to factory reset your phone. They can do this without having to crack your password by rebooting to the bootloader, then, to the stock recovery that all phones have, and they select the option to wipe data. 
        
        But why is such a dangerous feature so easily accessible? Well, turns out that it’s a security feature. If you forget your password, then, you will not be able to access your phone, being the only options you have to unlock it somehow, buying another one or factory resetting. This also can be used by people with bad intentions, but that’s why it exists.
        
        Google understood this, and starting with Lollipop, after factory resetting your phone via the recovery, when you go through the setup process, it will ask you to sign in to the last Google account linked to the device, stopping you from finishing the setup, and thus, being able to use the phone.
        
        I’ve seen that it can be bypassed, but probably they have already patched it.
        
        Because it is linked to your account, I guess that this won’t work with phones that do not have GMS.
        
        ## All Android phones have a codename
        
        In case you didn’t know, practically, all Android phones from known companies have codenames. This makes it very useful in the modding community to know exactly which device is which, skipping the branding or regional and modified versions’ names.
        
        For example, you might think that stuff made for the Poco X3 NFC is compatible with the X3 Pro, but they’re not the same phone, and you can confirm it by looking at the codenames: one is surya, and the other one is vayu.

        These are a type of zip files that you are able to move only with root to the /system/media directory. It will replace your stock boot animation with a custom one, even though it doesn’t always work for all ROMs, but it’s interesting to see that it’s a thing.

        Thanks to Linux and the AOSP, you’re able to create your own custom kernels and use them with different ROMs. Some provide patches or fixes, performance or battery life improvements or support for other devices or filesystems.
        
        Some popular ones are the Sultan kernel, arter97 kernel, ElementalX kernel, blue-spark kernel and the kirisakura kernel.

        Before the first official stable version of Android, there were some important releases, for example, the build htc 2065.0.8.0.0, which is the earliest known build of our OS. It already had a search bar, a dock, an app drawer, a browser, Gmail, a notepad, contacts, calculator, SMS and camera.
        
        Android m5 rc14a was the first build to include Touch UI support, a notifications panel, even though it was empty and new icons.
        
        Finally, we have Android 0.9, the final experimental version of the operating system, released along with the respective SDK. It is more familiar to what we know now, you can notice it by looking at the home screen.

        From 2016 to 2019, you were able to play a little mini game if you encountered the classic error 404, that means that the page of a website doesn't exist. In the game, Bugdroids launched pink donuts, blue jelly beans or white marshmallows to the center, and you had to rotate the glass pipes to send each dessert into its corresponding pipe.
        
        Now, if you get the same 404 error, you will get just a message, but no game.

        It is really interesting how Android can run on a lot of objects. For example, it powers fridges, like the Samsung T9000, treadmills, headphones, bicycles, cameras, like the Samsung Galaxy Camera, touch displays, like the ones made by Newline Interactive and even cases for iPhones.
        
        It’s believed to be the OS used by the Facebook Portal, Google Home and Amazon Echo smart speakers.
        
        But the spot for the weirdest thing running it definitely goes to this urinal. Why does this thing even need to have a screen is beyond my understanding, but you can clearly see that it runs Google’s OS.

I really don’t know why you would want to do that other than trying to recover your own app’s lost source code, which has actually happened to me. But if you try to do it for other apps, then I don’t know how legal that is, as some consider reverse engineering the code as violating the copyright.

        Do you remember 2016? If you do, you know that it was ruled by Pokémon Go. That Mobile game that used AR and location tracking to incite you to go out of your house and walk to find some Pokémon. The issue is that, even when the game tells you to look at your surroundings, a lot of people didn’t, and that could cause a lot of accidents, from falling, to crashing with some vehicles.

        Google’s OS allows you to use third party apps other than the Play Store. 
        
        For example, you have the Aurora Store, that allows you to download the exact same apps that are on the Play Store, but anonymously. Even though, you do have to sign in to purchase apps. It tells you the permissions and trackers that apps come with. It’s very useful if you plan to Degoogle.
        
        But if you’re a free software enthusiast, you should probably use F-Droid, that is a store where you can only find open source software. It looks a little bit dated and is slow when syncing repositories, so I would recommend you to use a better client like Droidify or the Neo Store, that have a more up to date design and more features.
        
        Other companies try to not rely too much on Google, and have made their own stores, like Samsung’s Galaxy Store, or Huawei’s App Gallery. They’re not as popular as the default store, but they do have some apps that you probably use.

        On May 23rd of 2020, in China, Samsung phones like the S8, S9, S10 and S20 series faced a serious bug, where some of them would get crash and reboot to the recovery. This happened because May 23rd is a date related to China’s Lunar Calendar, causing the system to calculate the time incorrectly, and then, fail if you didn’t update the Calendar app before this date.
        
        The solution was to change the date to one month earlier or to update the Calendar app, but I think this is something that we all wouldn’t want to happen to us.

        In 2013, Andy Rubin revealed that Android was originally meant for digital cameras. They wanted to create a platform where you would have cloud storage for images and videos, without having to rely on the internal storage. He showed the idea to investors, but the idea didn’t really caught on, claiming that “it wasn’t actually a big enough market”. They changed focus to now design a smartphone OS. Google came in, bought the company and you know the rest.

        Steve Jobs, the most iconic and important CEO of Apple really disliked Android, as he considered it as a betrayal from Google, because Apple worked with them in the development of the iPhone, and you can notice that by looking at one of the apps that came preinstalled with the original iPhone, being one of them Maps, powered by Google Maps. This was very similar to what had already happened to Apple with Windows, claiming that Microsoft stole the GUI concept.
        
        To reinforce Steve’s hate towards Android, here’s a quote that he said, taken from the book “Steve Jobs” by Walter Isaacson:
        
        “I will spend every penny of Apple’s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong. I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go thermonuclear war on this.”

        Sometimes, companies make weird collaborations, creating some special edition phones, like the Pepsi P1 and P1S. These were phones made back in 2016, with Pepsi branding. They were only available through a crowdfunding campaign on a Chinese site called JD.com. Interestingly, seems that the reviews were positive, and that it was overall a good mid ranger for its time and price. 
        
        I also wanted to mention that I find funny and sad that this ComputerWorld review calls the phone a “Phablet”, but it was only 5.5 inches, compared to the 6.6+ inches monstrosities that we currently have.
        
        It ran “DidoOS”, an Android skin also available for some Doogee phones. As expected, they were Pepsi themed.
        
        Huawei partnered with Kentucky Fried Chicken to make 5000 limited edition KFC phones, which are in reality, just a special version of the mid range Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus. It had a 5.5 inches 720p display, a Snapdragon 435 SOC, a 12MP camera, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, running Android 7. It came with ten thousand “K-dollars”, a virtual currency used by KFC in China, and there is a preinstalled music app that allows you to create playlists and share them in the restaurant. Overall, a unique phone, but I don’t think anyone would be seriously daily driving it. It’s very basic.
        
        Marshall, a music equipment company, made the Marshall London. A phone for artists. It was a very basic phone, with a Snapdragon 410, but its media consumption capabilities are way above your average phone. For example, there are front facing stereo speakers, a Cirrus Logic sound card and two audio jacks, that can be used for listening and recording.

        There are a lot of weird Android apps. I will only mention a few, starting with Shake Me. You have to do what the name of the app says, and when you do, a dancing batman appears with music. That’s it, but to be honest, it really did freak me out the first time I saw it. I was expecting a jumpscare, and I did kind of get it.
        
        The next app is called “Send Me To Heaven”, and encourages you to throw you phone very high. Of course, this has the risk of damaging property, other people and the phone itself. That’s why you have to accept a bunch of warnings before getting to play the game. I don’t recommend you to try it. I only did it for this video, and you can see that my score is ridiculously low.
        
        The Abu Moo collection is a series of applications that cost $400 each, making a total of $2400. What does it do, then? Well, it just adds a gem widget to your home screen. That’s it. It’s like saying you’re rich, but without explicitly saying so.
        
        Remember Gabe the Dog? Yeah, that dog that appeared on music memes. Well, there’s an app that features him, where you can tap on one of the Gabes that appear there, and each one will bark in a different note.
        
        Brain Wash is a generic puzzle game, but that features some very inappropriate mini-games that you can have an idea of by just looking at the pictures. For some reason, it is still on the Play Store.  
        
        But EAT: The Revolution is definitely the weirdest app from the list. The game tells you to tap to bite food. With a couple of bites, you eat the food. Then, a message appears, and you have to repeat the whole process again. That is unusual, but when it gets really weird is after you restart the game a couple of times and keep playing for some minutes. Then, you start to get weird objects to eat, like nasty shoes, teeth and baby dolls. Weird music and people laughing in the background starts to be heard. Then, you run out of food, and the credits appear.
        
        It looks like it has actually has a meaning, or at least that’s what the description of the app and messages lead me to believe. And my interpretation is that it has a critique against capitalism, where consumerism will lead us to a point where there will be no food left, and we will have to eat stuff that we’re not supposed to to survive… or they could just be trolling.

        There are apps like the one that you’re seeing right now, that lock down your phone and only allow you to use certain apps. It also disables hardware buttons and status bars.
        
        If you ask me, I don’t know how it is available on the Play Store, as blocking hardware buttons could be considered against the Store’s Terms of service. I mean, It’s almost malware. And forcing someone to use it, even in a work environment to me is one of the most toxic and dystopian things you can do.

        It’s a phone that tries to bridge the gap between a dumb and a normal smartphone, mainly for people who want to spend less time on their phones. 
        
        They achieve this by only providing a set of average, boring and useful tools, like a music player, calculator, gallery, notepad, calendar, clock and voice recorder. The icons are not even in color, to avoid provoking some emotion.
        
        It has some very basic specs, but I mean, you don't really need much. I think they’re enough, as the phone probably doesn’t even have GMS.

        Forensic science takes care of collecting evidence for an investigation. This also includes digital evidence, like chats, photos, videos and files. That’s why there are Forensic Tools designed to exploit some vulnerability on your phone with the objective of getting information from you.
        
        Some of these programs or companies are Cellebrite UFED, Oxygen Forensics, Magnet Axiom, Mobiledit and MD Next.
        
        If you’re planning on going to download any of these programs, let me tell you that they usually only sell them to organizations or governments, not to individuals. They should only be used to gather evidence of a suspect, not by people to spy on other people.

        Samsung is not afraid of experimenting. They have made some weird features, for example, the Samsung Air View , that will perform an action (usually a preview) when you hover your finger or the SPen over the area that you’re interested in. 
        
        This is taken a step further with the Air Gestures, that let you move your hand over the screen of the phone to accept calls, move between pictures or pages and to wake your phone up.
        
        Samsung’s Smart scroll moves the content that you’re seeing when you tilt your head. 
        
        Smart pause pauses the video you’re watching when you’re not looking at the screen. 
        
        These all seem very gimmicky to me, but I really have to admit that they were a lot of years ahead with the Smart Rotation feature. Like the name suggests, this is basically auto rotate, but based on your face. If that sounds familiar, it is because Android 12 introduced it, but they had it all way back since Android KitKat.
        
        A weird fact is that the S4 and Note 3 had temperature and humidity sensors for some reason. It seems that it was just something used to get that information, but nothing more.

        It’s a browser available for multiple platforms, including Android, designed specifically for anonymity, security and privacy. It works through something called Onion Routing, that encrypts everything that you do several times. Basically, nobody can track you if you use it.
        
        It has legitimate uses, like circumventing censorship and protecting yourself from trackers, but because it gives you access to .onion domains, which are only accessible by Tor, people can use it for illicit purposes. 
        
        One of its downsides is that it is usually very slow because it goes through those many layers. If you decide to use it, only do it for legal things.

It is quite slow, but is able to launch a couple of AOSP apps.

        JPay is a company that sells devices made for people in prisons. They ship them with a custom launcher, as expected, and they run very old versions of Android, which could be a double edged sword, because they will not have a lot of modern features, as they don’t need them, but I guess that JPay’s products could be more vulnerable to old exploits, which has actually happened before.

It features stacked widgets, a Panic Mode, similar to iOS’s Lockdown Mode and improved lock screen customization with widgets. They even made a page for its easter egg.

        A good example of this in Android is related to emojis. There are people that remember emojis that never existed. For example, a robber emoji, that could look like this, or like this. There never was a hiker emoji, nor a peas emoji either.

It cannot be removed by any program managers, and after being installed, you won’t find any icon or shortcut to open it. It will begin to send you images via text messaging every three to six hours including this creature.
        
        Eventually, the messages you will get will include pictures taken at locations near you. Getting these pictures will cause you to have visions about the entity.
        
        The only way to get rid of these effects is to stop exposure to the pictures prior to 90 hours after installation.
        
        ## Cancelled phones and projects

        Most of the times, we do see projects and phones getting released. Some succeed and some fail, but there are some times when we won’t ever know if it would have succeeded, because they got canceled before even getting to some significant production stage.
        
        We begin with the Essential Phone 2, that would be the successor of the first Essential product. If you didn’t know, this was a phone company made by Andy Rubin, one of the founders of Android, and promised to have stock Android phones with a lot of updates and openness. However, the company got shut down before ever releasing a second phone. You’re seeing images of its prototype. There were plans for what is believed to be even an Essential Phone 3. The most interesting Essential’s prototype would be the Essential Gem, which is this smartphone with a ridiculously tall aspect ratio, that looks more like a TV Remote, and we don’t even know if it ran Android, but it had a card focused UI.
        
        Samsung’s Project Valley consisted of a phone with two screens. One was huge, and the other one was very thin. It seems that it was from some years ago, judging by the design the phone has, with capacitive buttons and running TouchWiz.
        
        One very interesting and unique phone was the Mi Mix Alpha, that had a display that wrapped around all the phone, except for a vertical bar, where the cameras are. On the side, you would be able to see your status bar, as well as the volume level. On the back, you would see your widgets. A futuristic phone, but it had some important issues, mainly regarding durability and false touches detection.
        
        Finally, we have to mention not a phone, but a project. Google’s Project Ara proposed phones that had modular components. For example, if your camera broke, you would just swap out the old module and swap in a new one. This would also allow you to upgrade components easier, like the storage or battery. A great proposal that I wish it could’ve succeeded, but it ended up being cancelled due to expensive parts and heavy, bulky phones.
        
        ## Access random Android webcams
        
        There are some websites that allow you to get access to  webcams, which some are powered by Android. Usually, these are in public places and don’t have any password, but there are some that could be in private property. I don’t know how legal this is, even if you only access the public ones, so I will not share a link for the website and I don’t encourage you to visit them. 
        
        The way they get access to these cameras can be because some willingly allows you to see their content, but some in other websites could have been hacked. So, if you have a webcam, make sure to change the default settings, at least, to be protected.

        As we’ve seen with vulnerabilities like DirtyCOW, it is not only very likely, but practically a fact that there could be hundreds or thousands of them throughout the whole OS that could and will be exploited for multiple purposes, like installing malware or to gather forensic evidence. Remember, there is no such thing as a bug or vulnerability-proof software.

Of course, this has not been proven and it’s not legal at all, so don’t try it, but we’ve already seen tools that let you decompile apps, and other ones like Lucky Patcher that modify programs to benefit you, so it could have happened already.

        It is believed that there have been apps and firmwares (mainly from Wish.com or very cheap phones) that have gone lost, due to being so unknown or private. This entry also includes Android builds that never got released to the public and that are probably kept in some drive at Google. All of this is similar to the Lost media concept, but with software for Android.
        
        ## Apps with 0 downloads
        
        It is a fact that there are thousands or way more apps that have never gotten and probably never will get even just one download. This makes me think: What kind of content would these apps have? I mean, they could probably be your usual Candy Crush clone, but they could host very weird, probably unmoderated content that was missed by the Play Store’s upload review process. Some of these are probably viruses. Keep in mind that the fee that you have to pay to publish all apps you want for a lifetime is of $25.

        This is a suspicion that I think we all have, but it is in the lowest tier of the iceberg because it is not a conspiracy. It’s a fact that can be proven.
        
        Go to your Settings app, then, to the Google section, tap on “Manage your Google Account”. There, tap on the “Data & Privacy” tab. Scroll down and you’ll find the data that this company has been collecting about you since you created your account. It saves whatever you’ve seen from your feed, the Play Store pages you’ve visited, the notifications sent by Firebase, at what time, if you have clicked them, from what device and location. 
        
        If you have Location history turned on, which by default you do, Google will save where you’ve been and for how long. All of this since you created your account, which can mean that they know where you were at 3 years ago.
        
        It is truly creepy tech, which can be used for good things, like knowing where your phone is if it got robbed, but I think that the price to pay can be a little too high. Imagine if it was used to manipulate your political or social opinions.
        
        Of course, you can disable the tracking, but you will lose its benefits. Also, how do you know if it’s really turned off? Like, there have been news of them tracking you even when you turned it off. 
        
        Just something to really think about.

        According to the New York Times and other outlets, Rubin had very toxic behavior towards his subordinates, thinking “they were stupid”. He also dated other women while he was married to somebody else, pressuring a Google employee into doing inappropriate stuff I cannot mention. Also, some content was found on his work computer.
        
        Google quietly paid Rubin a $150 million stock grant, and fired him, with the condition of agreeing with a clause that prevents him from criticizing the company. 
        
        ## Apps with NSFL content

            - [x]  Obscure Telegram groups
            - [x]  Apps that promote terrorism
        
        NSFW and NSFL are not the same thing. If I wasn’t recommending you to look up the first one, I wouldn’t ever recommend you to look for the latter. It is content so disturbing that can truly traumatize you, to the point where you have to go to therapy. Some of it might not even be legal.
        
        Unfortunately, there is always the possibility of apps or games having this content, mainly, social medias. For example, some trolls can raid a Discord server sending these pictures, and they will get banned and removed, but the damage will already be done.
        
        Sadly, it is also known that there are obscure Telegram groups where people gather to share this type of media, and even encourage others to harm people or other beings, and promoting terrorism. 
        
        If you ever have the bad luck of encountering any of these, report them immediately to Telegram, and also to the police.
        
        ## Cruz’s phone content and internet searches
        
        Cruz was a nasty person that did something at a school. He had an Android Lollipop or Marshmallow phone, and its contents are publicly available. Don’t look it up, as it is reported to all be NSFL stuff.

            - [x]  Over the Horizon 2019 version ruined
        
        Ronnie was a veteran that suffered from depression. He took his own life in a live video. His girlfriend was calling him, be he won’t respond. All you can hear is his Samsung phone’s Over The Horizon ringtone ringing over… and over again. 
        
        It is said that people that have watched the video can get awful memories and trauma by listening to that ringtone.
        

 

- **Outro**
    
    This was probably the most interesting video I’ve ever made. The thing got really dark on the bottom.
    
    This video took me several weeks to be completed, so I would appreciate if you could share it or interact with it if you enjoyed it. My next iceberg will probably come out in December or in very late 2022, to close the year, and it’s gonna be the Apple iceberg. I know that it breaks a little with the Operating System Icebergs tradition, but I have a good excuse for that: Apple doesn’t have only one OS, so I would have to make a video for each one, and I don’t know if it’s even worth it. Like, nobody’s gonna watch the tvOS Iceberg, so it’s better to include all Apple’s OSes and maybe even some other things related to it in the iceberg. Just don’t expect it to be as ambitious as this one. I never expected it to be this long. So, the next one will probably only last an hour or an hour and a half.
    
    This was all for today, if you watched all the way till the end, I really don’t know how to thank you. Goodbye world, see you in the next one.
